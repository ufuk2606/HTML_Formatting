                <h1>Semantics in HTML</h1>
            </legend>
            <p><span>&#128073;</span> In HTML, for example, the <code><b>&lt;h1&gt;</b></code> element is a semantic
                element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of " a top level heading on your
                page."</p>
            <details>
                <summary>
                    <mark> Here is a top level heading</mark>
                </summary>
            </details>
            <p><span>&#128073;</span> By default, most browsers user agent stylesheet will style <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>
                with a large font
                size to make it look like a heading (although you could style it to look anything you wanted) On the
                other hand, you could make any elemnt look like a top level heading. </p>
            <details>
                <summary>
                    <mark> Consider the following</mark>
                </summary>
            </details>
            <p><span>&#10158;</span>This will render it to look like a top level heading, but it has no semanticvalue,
                so
                it will not get any extra benefits as describes as above. It is therefore a good idea to use the right
                HTML element for the right job.</p>
            <p><span>&#10158;</span>HTML should be coded to represent the data that will be populated and not based on
                its default presentation styling. Presentation (how it should look
                ), is the sole responsibility of CSS. </p>

                <h3>Some of the benefits from writing semantic markup are as follows:</h3>
            </legend>
            <ul>
                <li>Search engines will consider its content as importent keywords to
                    influence the page`s search rankings (See <a
                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SEO">SEO</a> )
                </li>
                <li> Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired
                    users navigate a page
                </li>
                <li>Finding blocks of meainingful code is significantly easier than
                    searching through endless divs with or without semantic or
                    namespaced classes
                </li>
                <li>Suggests to the devoloper the type of data that will be populated
                </li>
                <li>Semantic neaming mirrors proper custom element/component naming
